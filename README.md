Wireframe Exercise lab 9

HTML/CSS Wireframe Exercise
Wireframe Overview
Create a new repo titled 'wirefame-exercise', making sure to configure it with index.html, style.css, and reset.css (use Eric Meyer's reset).

We will be building a professional-style wireframe document, to a provided spec, using just HTML and CSS. This workflow is similar to what we would encounter in an environment where there is a designer on the team: the designer creates a design comp (short for comprehensive) that shows us what the final version should look like, plus, a document with annotations about specific sizes and features.

Note: All of the images in this document are in the adjacent images/ directory
